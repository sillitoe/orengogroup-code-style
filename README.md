OrengoGroup Coding Guide
========================

This project attempts to provide guidance for people working on shared code within the [Orengo Bioinformatics group at UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/orengo-group).

The project itself is intended to be an evolving set of working documents. If people have ideas / suggestions about how these pages can be improved, please do so in the form of a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), [raising an issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), or just telling someone.

What this aims to be
--------------------

The aim here is very much to encourage **contribution**, **consistency** and **new skills** within the group. Those words are pretty self-explanatory, but I'll add some unnecessary pseudo-quotes to make the whole thing sound terribly profound:

 * **Contribution** - *No matter what your skills or experience, everyone can contribute something. You just need to know how.* 
  
  Everyone can contribute something. Somebody with zero experience is a valuable resource - they contribute a fresh pair of eyes (massive help for improving documentation, tutorials, etc). We aim to encourage contribution by being clear about how people can go about contributing.

 * **Consistency** - *There is no single, right way to code. But there are lots of bad ways to code.*
 
  Making mistakes is a valuable part of the learning process - especially if you find solutions then take steps to avoid the same mistake happening in the future. However, when working on shared code, you want to be protected from other people's mistakes. Especially when working on services and tools that are used outside of the lab. It's very useful that everyone agrees on some core principles to do with coding, committing, testing.

 * **New Skills** - *An expert is just someone who has already made all possible mistakes*

  There are loads of different skills and experiences in the lab. Everyone can learn from everyone by sharing best practices, performing group code reviews, etc.

What this does not aim to be
----------------------------

These pages are not meant to represent the perfect way to code. 

Many excellent coders will be happy to spend an evening arguing about whether to use spaces or tabs for white-space (NB: clearly you should use spaces). Others will be happy to debate the merits of 2 spaces over 4 spaces. Those kind of discussions are not what these pages are about. However, there may be some house rules that others may find contentious or arbitrary. Sometimes it's better to just settle on one way of doing things even if there are lots of equally good ways to do things.

If people in the group have issues with anything here then we use that as a point of discussion: we discuss why they're there, discuss possible alternatives and make changes if everyone agrees there's a better way of doing it. That's one of the reasons why we chose to host these documents on GitHub.
