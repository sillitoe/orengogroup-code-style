OrengoGroup Code Style Guide
============================

This project attempts to provide guidance for people working on shared code within the Orengo Bioinformatics group at UCL.
There is no single, right way to code. However, when working on shared code, it is very useful if everyone agrees on some
core principles.

What this is
------------

Notice the use of the word *guidance*. The intention here is very much to encourage:

 * contribution (by being clear about how people can go about contribute)
 * consistency and standards (by agreeing on core principles)
 * new skills (by sharing best practices and code reviews)

This project itself is intended to be a set of working, evolving documents. If people have ideas / suggestions about how these
pages can be improved, please issue a pull request.

What this is not
----------------

These pages are not meant to represent the perfect way to code. Many coders will be happy to argue about whether to use
spaces or tabs for white-space (NB: clearly you should use spaces). Others will debate the merits of 2 spaces over 4 spaces. 
Some of the guidelines in these pages may be contentious, and others may be unsuitable for other setups. They are tuned
for coding within the Orengo group.
