OrengoGroup Coding Guide
========================

This project attempts to provide guidance for people working on shared code within the [Orengo Bioinformatics group at UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/orengo-group).

The project itself is intended to be an evolving set of working documents. If people have ideas / suggestions about how these pages can be improved, please do so in the form of a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), [raising an issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), or just telling someone.

What this project aims to be
----------------------------

The aim here is very much to encourage **contribution**, **consistency** and **new skills** within the group. Those words are pretty self-explanatory, but I'll add some glib pseudo-quotes to make it sound utterly profound:

 * **Contribution** - *No matter what your skills or experience, everyone can contribute something. You just need to know how.* 
  
  Somebody with zero experience still contributes a fresh pair of eyes (and can be an invaluable resource for improving documentation, tutorials, etc). We aim to encourage contribution by being clear about how people can go about contributing.

 * **Consistency** - *There is no single, right way to code. But there are lots of bad ways to code.**
 
  Making mistakes is a valuable part of the learning process - especially if you find solutions then take steps to avoid the same mistake happening in the future. However, when working on shared code, you want to be protected from other people's mistakes. It's very useful if everyone agrees on some core principles to do with coding and committing.

 * **New Skills** - *An expert is just someone who has already made all possible mistakes*

  There are loads of different skills and experiences in the lab. Everyone can learn from everyone by sharing best practices, performing group code reviews, etc.

What this project does not aim to be
------------------------------------

These pages are not meant to represent the perfect way to code. 

Many coders will be happy to spend an evening arguing about whether to use spaces or tabs for white-space (NB: clearly you should use spaces). Others will be happy to debate the merits of 2 spaces over 4 spaces. Those kind of discussions are not what these pages are about. However, there may be some house rules that others may find contentious or arbitrary.

If people in the group have issues with anything here then we use that as a point of discussion: we discuss why they're there, discuss possible alternatives and make changes if everyone agrees there's a better way of doing it. That's one of the reasons why we chose to host these documents on GitHub.

They are house rules tuned for coding within the Orengo group.
