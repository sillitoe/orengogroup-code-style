OrengoGroup Coding Guide
========================

This project attempts to provide guidance for people working on shared code within the [Orengo Bioinformatics group at UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/orengo-group).

The project itself is intended to be an evolving set of working documents. If people have ideas / suggestions about how these pages can be improved, please do so in the form of a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), [raising an issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), or just telling someone.

What this project IS
--------------------

The aim of these documents is very much to encourage:

 * **Contribution**

  *No matter what your skills or experience, everyone can contribute something. You just need to know how.* 
  
  Somebody with zero experience still contributes a fresh pair of eyes (and can be an invaluable resource for improving documentation, tutorials, etc). We aim to encourage contribution by being clear about how people can go about contributing.

 * **Consistency**
 
  *There is no single, right way to code.*

  But there are lots of bad ways to code. Making mistakes is a valuable part of the learning process - especially if you find solutions and avoid the same mistakes happening in the future. However, when working on shared code, you want to be protected from other people's mistakes. It's very useful if everyone agrees on some core principles.

 * **Skills**
 
 *An expert is just someone who has already made all possible mistakes*

  There are loads of different skills and experiences in the lab. Everyone can learn from everyone by sharing best practices, performing group code reviews, etc.

What this project IS NOT
------------------------

These pages are not meant to represent the perfect way to code. Many coders will be happy to argue about whether to use spaces or tabs for white-space (NB: clearly you should use spaces). Others will debate the merits of 2 spaces over 4 spaces. 
Some of the guidelines in these pages may be contentious, and others may be unsuitable for other setups. They are tuned for coding within the Orengo group.

Enough already, show me the money
